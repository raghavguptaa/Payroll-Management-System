Abstract

Colour-blind people or people with a colour vision deficiency have to face many challenges in their daily activities. 
Their disadvantage to perceive colours incorrectly leads to frustration when determining the freshness of fruits and 
the rawness of meat as well as the problem to distinguish clothes with confusing colours. With the rise of the smartphone, 
numerous mobile applications are developed to overcome those problems, improving the quality of live. However, smartphones 
also have some limitations in certain use cases. Especially activities where both hands are needed do not suit well for 
smartphone applications. Furthermore, there exist tasks in which a continuous use of a smartphone is not possible or even 
not legally allowed such as driving a car. In recent years, fairly new apps have been made to test. But still they are not “FREE”, so 
with this project we allow all the people to test themselves at anytime and anywhere and that to for free.
